      <FONT color="beige" size=3 face="Times New Roman" > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ◎ 𓅜 I woke up at 4:30 am so early as I had to reach school by 7:00 am. I was doing all my works so quickly but for certain reason I had to go to our market and most of my time went there only. 🐰 Even though I was becoming much punctual, my time was going so quickly. I came home from the market by 6:30 am. 🧖‍♂️I took bath and went for the breakfast, when I heard my father talking to someone in his phone. That person told him that the trip bus had left the school campus and told me to went there urgently.✨ After a while one another call came, which told that the bus had reached "Wahab Bazaar". I hurried and luckily, i got the bus and we together went to Hohua, by dancing🕺,jumping and singing🎤 all the way. On the way, the bus had stopped two times. At first, near "Lakhipur", where I dropped from the bus for eating "jhalmuri" (a dry dish made with spices). and I don't know the name of the place where it stopped the second time.➹ I just heard someone saying that "The tyre was pumtured and they were repairing that" It was hardly noticable what was happening outside the bus as i gave more importance in dancing. At the last moment,🧊when we are about to reach there, I peeked outside through the window, when I saw some large, high mountains and a few cows and pigs grazing in the grasslands infront of the mountains ♤.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_-.🌟 We reached there by 1:30 am, after a long trip of about 7hrs. I jumped out of the bus and went, where the students were gathered.♛ I was a small platform made of only bricks, which was divided into two parts - the half for cooking and on the other half a small bench like structure is given on it's opposite for sitting, with two entry passages from the middle.𓆣 I went there sat on the bench with others. There we got a slight breakfast of two slices with jam,a banana🍌 and a small piece of apple 🍎. I also took one extra slice from our teacher, who was serving the slices. After fulfilling our stomach, we went to roam and visit the beautiful parts of "Hohua". One interesting thing is that, All the students of our school who came to this trip had gone to roam with our teachers but we the four boys of our class went separately thinking that we will get more freedom and will be able to click more photos than than the students who were with the teachers. We had two smartphones with best cameras, so we clicked as much photos we wanted. At first , I saw a small house with a bridge, a little up with stairs . Then I saw the first and the main waterfall there , which was quite small🤏. The river formed by the waterfall is full of huge rocks and below it I saw some orange colour-sand instead of wet land . The river is between two✌ high mountains on two sides . I saw many kinds of trees🌲. There were mostly bamboo trees on the river sides . I had not seen any fruit🍍-giving trees there. I also don't know most of the names of the plants and trees I have seen . I have seen two waterfalls , one at first,🧊which was so close to the spot and the another one that we saw is so much larger than the first one and was so wonderful . I was first shocked by watching 👀 that . The water came down the rocks and making a very heavy splashing sound 🔊 __ <BR>
I will let you to hear :- <br />

I think that was the best ever thing to watch at Hohua . We clicked photos there and went back to the spot . We also got a little punishment for becoming late on reaching  the spot 📍. I had not seen any animal there as it should be , except dogs 🐶. I also noticed a very good thing there which was the dustbin . look's crazy right! . But it is - It was much larger than an ordinary dustbin and had a small door🚪 for dogs to enter clear the food thrown into it . There were not much crowd on that day as I saw only one bus 🚍 there except our's. I also drank the purest water 💧 from the falls . ______ There was a system which I think is not so good 😒 is that we have to pay for doing toilet 🚽. 
By the way, after roaming we came back and had a wonderful lunch 🍝🥗with meat 🥩 and rice 🍚. After that I went to a shop , bought some chips and returned to the Bus 🚍.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ⛧ That's all about my ➹ trip to Hohua which went so excitefully and joyfully . I would prefer you to visit at least one time ⌚ there if you are a nature🌿 lover . All the people there are "garo" so to interect with them you must at least know how to speak in Hindi . There are very few shops there , so I would prefer you to buy things from outside before going there if you are wilfull 𓆡..
